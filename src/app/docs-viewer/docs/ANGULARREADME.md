> ### Development server

>> To start a local development server, run:

```bash
          ng serve
```

>> Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

> ### Code scaffolding

>> Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
          ng generate component component-name
```

>> For a complete list of available schematics (such as _components_, _directives_, or _pipes_), run:

```bash
          ng generate --help
```

> ### Building

>> To build the project run:

```bash
          ng build
```

>> This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the _dist/_ directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

> ### Running unit tests

>> To execute unit tests with the <a href="https://karma-runner.github.io" target="_blanks">[Karma]</a> test runner, use the following command:

```bash
          ng test
```

> ### Running end-to-end tests

>> For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
          ng e2e
```

>> Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.

> ### Additional Resources
